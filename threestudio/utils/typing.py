"""
This module contains type annotations for the project, using
1. Python type hints (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for Python objects
2. jaxtyping (https://github.com/google/jaxtyping/blob/main/API.md) for PyTorch tensors

Two types of typing checking can be used:
1. Static type checking with mypy (install with pip and enabled as the default linter in VSCode)
2. Runtime type checking with typeguard (install with pip and triggered at runtime, mainly for tensor dtype and shape checking)
